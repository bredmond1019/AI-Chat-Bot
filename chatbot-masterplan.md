# AI Chat Bot Application Masterplan

## 1. App Overview and Objectives

This AI Chat Bot application aims to provide efficient customer support for a Health Tech Startup. The chatbot will read through data from an external API and answer customer queries about the company's application. Key objectives include:

- Develop an MVP for demonstration purposes
- Implement real-time, streaming responses
- Handle concurrent requests efficiently
- Provide concise, relevant answers with links to additional information

## 2. Target Audience

- Customers of the Health Tech Startup seeking support or information about the company's application

## 3. Core Features and Functionality

- Real-time chat interface
- AI-powered response generation using Llama 3.1 7B model
- Integration with external help documentation API
- Streaming responses word-by-word or token-by-token
- Handling of long user queries by extracting key information
- Provision of relevant links to additional resources

## 4. High-level Technical Stack Recommendations

- Backend: Rust with Actix Web Framework
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Real-time Communication: WebSockets
- Database: Postgres (for future scalability)
- AI Model: Llama 3.1 7B
- HTTP Client: reqwest library

## 5. Conceptual Data Model

- User Session: Temporary storage for ongoing conversations
- Chat Message: Stores user queries and bot responses
- API Cache: Optional, for storing frequently accessed help documentation

## 6. User Interface Design Principles

- Clean, intuitive chat interface
- Clear distinction between user and bot messages
- Visual indicator for streaming responses
- Easy-to-click links for additional resources

## 7. Security Considerations

While not a priority for the MVP, future considerations should include:
- User authentication
- Data encryption
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization

## 8. Development Phases

1. Setup and Configuration
   - Set up Rust backend with Actix Web
   - Configure React frontend with TypeScript
   - Establish WebSocket connection

2. Core Functionality
   - Implement chat interface
   - Integrate Llama 3.1 7B model
   - Develop API integration for help documentation

3. Enhanced Features
   - Implement streaming responses
   - Develop long query parsing and key information extraction
   - Add relevant link suggestions

4. Testing and Optimization
   - Perform unit and integration testing
   - Optimize for concurrent requests
   - Conduct user acceptance testing

5. Deployment and Demo Preparation
   - Deploy MVP
   - Prepare demonstration materials

## 9. Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. Challenge: Handling long user queries
   Solution: Implement a preprocessing step to extract key information before querying the AI model

2. Challenge: Ensuring real-time performance with concurrent users
   Solution: Utilize Rust's concurrency features and Actix Web's asynchronous capabilities

3. Challenge: Integrating Llama 3.1 7B model efficiently
   Solution: Consider using a separate service or API for model inference to offload processing

## 10. Future Expansion Possibilities

- User authentication and personalized responses
- Integration with more data sources
- Advanced analytics and performance monitoring
- Multi-language support
- Voice interface integration

This masterplan provides a high-level overview of your AI Chat Bot application. It serves as a starting point for your MVP development and can be adjusted as needed throughout the development process.
